# CS50W Commerce

This project is part of the CS50W course. In this project I created an online e-commerce site which allowed users to sign in and register, post new listing for items being sold, allowed users to bid on posted listings and more.

Languages Used - Python, HTML, CSS with Django generated SQL.
